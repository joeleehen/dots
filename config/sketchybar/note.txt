A note on changing colors:
I have two colorschemes of the same sketchybar to switch back and forth quickly
it's janky but here's how I switch from one to the other:

cp gruv_colors gary
mv gary sketchybarrc

just create a copy of the colorschemes (I named him gary) and move it to sketchybarrc

don't judge
